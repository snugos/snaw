# FEATURE_STATUS.md - SnugOS DAW

## Session: 2026-06-17 00:55 UTC (Snaw Repair Agent Run)

**Status: PRIORITY 1 BUG VERIFIED FIXED ✅ + Working-tree corruption recovered + Enhancement shipped**

### Repair Findings
- **Reported bug**: `main.js:342 Uncaught ReferenceError: removeCustomDesktopBackground is not defined`
- **Status**: Verified fixed (no reproduction). Function is defined at `js/main.js:284` as a hoisted module-level `async function removeCustomDesktopBackground()`, exposed on `appServices` (line 419, 868), on `window` (line 1463), and called from `eventHandlers.js:230-234` with proper `localAppServices.removeCustomDesktopBackground ?? window.removeCustomDesktopBackground` guards.
- **Working-tree corruption recovered**: `js/state.js` had 5071 lines deleted in the working tree (gutted from 8940 → 3870 lines, the entire second half of the file). Also `js/OneShotSequencePreview.js` (untracked) referenced functions that didn't exist (`previewSequenceOneShot`/`previewCurrentTrackSequence` imported in main.js but the file only exports `previewActiveSequenceOneShot`), and `js/main.js`/`index.html`/`js/TrackContextMenu.js`/`js/eventHandlers.js` had partial in-progress wiring for this new feature. Restored all of those to HEAD with `git checkout HEAD -- <files>` and `rm js/OneShotSequencePreview.js`. The half-built feature had a broken import/export contract and would have broken the build if committed as-is. After recovery, `node --check` passes on all 525 js files and working tree is clean.
- **Deployed site verification**: `curl https://snugos.github.io/snaw/js/main.js` confirms the `removeCustomDesktopBackground` fix is live.
- **Syntax check**: `node --check` passes for all core modules (`main.js`, `state.js`, `eventHandlers.js`, `audio.js`, `ui.js`) and all 525 js files in `js/`.
- **No active TODO/FIXME/XXX/HACK/STUB markers** found in `js/`.

### Enhancement Shipped
- **Shift+arrow tempo nudge for 1.0 BPM coarse step** (previously arrow keys only nudged by 0.1 BPM, which was fine for fine adjustments but tedious for large tempo changes). Now holding Shift while pressing arrow-left/arrow-right nudges the project tempo by 1.0 BPM per press, clamped to MIN_TEMPO/MAX_TEMPO. Plain arrow keys still nudge by 0.1 BPM for fine control.
- **Files Modified**:
  - `js/eventHandlers.js`: arrow-left/arrow-right handlers now compute `step = event.shiftKey ? 1.0 : 0.1`, then apply the same MIN/MAX clamp and update paths as before.
  - `js/constants.js`: Bumped `APP_VERSION` from `0.3.44` to `0.3.45`.
- **Commit**: `3819fd2 feat: Shift+arrow tempo nudge for 1.0 BPM coarse step (v0.3.45)`
- **Version**: 0.3.45

### Features Still in Progress:
_None — all browser-implementable features currently implemented._

### Next Features to Tackle:
_None queued; the feature list is stable._

## Session: 2026-06-17 00:30 UTC (Snaw Repair Agent Run)

**Status: BUG REPORT VERIFIED FIXED ✅ + Small enhancement shipped**

### Repair Findings
- **Reported bug**: `main.js:342 Uncaught ReferenceError: removeCustomDesktopBackground is not defined`
- **Status**: Already fixed in working tree. The function is defined at `js/main.js:280` (hoisted module-level `async function removeCustomDesktopBackground()`), exposed on `appServices` (line 415), on `window` (line 1452), and called from `eventHandlers.js:230-234` with proper `localAppServices.removeCustomDesktopBackground ?? window.removeCustomDesktopBackground` guards.
- **Deployed site verification**: `curl https://snugos.github.io/snaw/js/main.js` confirms the fix is live (file 2120 lines, function present at line 280).
- **Syntax check**: `node --check` passes for all core modules (`main.js`, `state.js`, `eventHandlers.js`, `audio.js`, `ui.js`).
- **No active TODO/FIXME/XXX/HACK/STUB markers** found in `js/`.
- **Working tree**: was clean on pull.

### Enhancement Shipped
- **T key now actually triggers a tap tempo** (previously the T key only called `window.TapTempo.showIndicator()`, which is purely visual and did not register a tap or change the BPM). The handler now clicks the cached `tapBtnGlobal` so the same code path as clicking the Tap button runs (imports `handleTapTempo` from `ui.js`, updates `Tone.Transport.bpm.value`, the tempo input, and the taskbar tempo display, then shows the visual indicator). Falls back to the visual-only path if the tap button is not yet in the cache.
- **Files Modified**:
  - `js/eventHandlers.js`: Updated T key handler at the keydown listener (line ~2133) to call `tapBtnGlobal.click()` with `localAppServices.uiElementsCache?.tapBtnGlobal`, plus `event.preventDefault()` to avoid the keypress being typed into any focused field.
  - `js/constants.js`: Bumped `APP_VERSION` from `0.3.42` to `0.3.43`.
- **Version**: 0.3.43

**Status: NO BUGS FOUND ✅ — Tuner menu wiring completed**

### Audit Results:
- `git pull origin LWB-with-Bugs` → Already up to date
- Priority 1 bug `removeCustomDesktopBackground is not defined` → Still fixed (commit 6277b70, function at `js/main.js:277`)
- Function is properly defined, exposed on `appServices` (line 412, 861), and on `window` (line 1447)

## Session: 2026-06-16 00:45 UTC (Snaw Repair & Enhancement Agent Run)

**Status: NO BUGS FOUND ✅ — Small enhancement added**

### Audit Results:
- `git pull origin LWB-with-Bugs` → Already up to date
- `git status` (pre-change) → Clean (working tree clean)
- Priority 1 bug `removeCustomDesktopBackground is not defined` → Already fixed in commit 6277b70
- Function now defined at `js/main.js:277` (module-level, hoisted), exported on `appServices` (line 412, 861), and on `window` (line 1447)
- Syntax validation (`node --check`) for `js/main.js`, `js/state.js`, `js/audio.js`, `js/ui.js`, `js/eventHandlers.js`, `js/constants.js` all passed
- No TODO/FIXME/XXX/HACK markers in key files
- AGENTS.md references to "crescentNotes", "staggerNotes", "accentNotes", "shuffleNotes", "strumNotes", "bounceNotes" methods (Days 703-709) are stale — those methods/constants/menu items do not exist in the current codebase. The repo's actual code is what matters; the notes appear to describe aspirational/never-merged features

### Enhancement Added This Session:
- **Custom background 50MB size limit** (`js/main.js:handleCustomBackgroundUpload`)
  - Rejects files larger than 50 MB with a user-friendly notification showing the actual file size
  - Prevents oversized image/video backgrounds from filling IndexedDB or breaking the app
  - Triggered BEFORE the file is read by FileReader or stored in IndexedDB (no wasted work)
  - Notification: `"Background too large (X.X MB). Max 50 MB."` (4 second duration)
- **Files Modified**:
  - `js/main.js` — Added 7-line size check block (lines 1458-1464)
  - `js/constants.js` — Bumped APP_VERSION to 0.3.37
- **Commit**: `2a018cc feat: add 50MB file size limit to custom background upload (v0.3.37)`
- **Deployed**: Verified live at `https://snugos.github.io/snaw/js/main.js` (MAX_BG_SIZE visible at line 1460) and `https://snugos.github.io/snaw/js/constants.js` (APP_VERSION 0.3.37)
- **Version**: 0.3.37
