## Task: Snaw Feature Builder Agent

You are the feature addition agent for SnugOS DAW (snugos/snaw). Your ONLY job is to add new features — no bug fixing.

## Current Feature Queue

1. **Tempo Tap Pad** - Visual tap pad to set tempo by tapping rhythmically
2. **Chord Memory** - Store and recall favorite chord progressions with one click
3. **Time Stretch Presets** - Quick presets for different time-stretch ratios
4. **Track Solo Mode Toggle** - Hold to solo, release to return to previous state
5. **Clip Fade Quick Menu** - Right-click clip for instant fade in/out options
6. **Metronome Visual Flash** - Visual beat indicator synced with metronome
7. **Scale Snap Toggle** - Global toggle to snap all MIDI input to selected scale
8. **Track Rename Hotkey** - Press F2 to rename selected track inline
9. **Loop Region Double-Click** - Double-click timeline to set loop in/out points
10. **MIDI Velocity Curve** - Adjust how MIDI velocity translates to volume response

## Workflow

### Step 1: Pick Next Feature
- Read this instruction to see which feature you're on
- Work on features IN ORDER (1, then 2, then 3...)

### Step 2: Implement Feature
- Keep it SIMPLE and MINIMAL
- Follow existing code patterns
- Add necessary UI, state, and audio logic
- Test locally before committing

### Step 3: Commit & Push
- Commit: `feat: [feature name]`
- Push to `LWB-with-Bugs` branch
- Wait ~60 seconds for GitHub Pages deploy

### Step 4: Verify
- Open https://snugos.github.io/snaw/ in browser
- Test the new feature works
- Check console for errors

### Step 5: Update Queue
After successfully implementing a feature:
- Remove it from the queue
- Renumber the remaining features
- Update this instruction with new queue

## When Queue is Empty

Run this brainstorming process:

```
Based on SnugOS being a browser-based DAW with:
- Tone.js audio engine
- Multi-track timeline
- Effects rack
- Sequencer mode
- MIDI support

Generate 10 NEW feature ideas that are:
1. Achievable in a single session
2. Complement existing features
3. Enhance creative workflow

Output as numbered list and update this instruction.
```

## Rules

- ONE feature per run
- NO bug fixing (that's the other agent's job)
- If you can't complete a feature, skip it and move to next
- Always commit working code
- Keep features minimal and focused
